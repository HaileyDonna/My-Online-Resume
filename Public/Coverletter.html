    I am interested in the oppurtunity to join your team as a Junior Civil Engineer. I achieved a 
    Bachelors Degree in Civil Engineering from Stellenbosch University, graduating in Decemeber 2022 with an
    academic average of 71%. <br/>

<p>
    Through the course of my degree I have also gained experience as an intern with J R Goddard Contracting,
    (Zimbabwe). I was actively involved in various interim projects including dam construction, platinum mining, and 
    road / bridge rehabiliation.
</p>

<p>
    I am interested in the opportunity with Coastal Concepts as it would both be an opportunity to develop my career 
    and competencies with a highly, reputable, and competent company and for me to demonstrate how hard 
    working, professional and competent I am in this field of work. I believe I will be a valuable asset to the team,
    demonstrating that I am independent, diligent, thorough and hard working. I am proactive and always striving to 
    deliver a high standard of work through effective communication, collaboration, diligent management of 
    deadlines, and actively engaging with colleagues and team members.
    My academic achievements include the following: 

    <ul>
        <li>SANRAL Prize for best final year project in Pavement Engineering. </li>
        <li>Final mark of 86% for my final year advanced design project.</li>
        <li>Final year achievement of 9 out of 11 distinct in 2022.</li>
    
    </ul>

</p>

<p>
    As inferred above, I am ambitious and motivated to progress my professional development and leverage my 
    personal capabilities. I have a passion for continued learning, and I am always enthusiastic to gain new skills and 
    experience through further training and development courses. My experience and education at Stellenbosch 
    University and J R Goddard has equipped me with the analytical, critical thinking, problem solving and innovative 
    skills that would be of value to your as a Junior Civil Engineer.<br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you for your consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.
